                        <h3>1. Requirements and chat</h3>
                        <p>We work with you to learn what your project requirements are, making suggestions and helping prioritse the requirements.</p>

                        <h3>2. Development plan</h3>
                        <p>We put together a brief development plan, outlining the first phase of development, the product back-log, priorities, guidelines for subsequent phases, timescales and costs.</p>

                        <p>We get your project setup on codebase (project management and code hosting), continuous integration (automated testing and code quality) and with any infrastructure that is required (testing servers, cloud services, analytics, error logging, email tracking, etc).</p>

                        <p>We develop in sprints based off the development plan. The first sprint is agreed as part of the development plan. As code is written and code tests pass, the code is deployed to testing servers for feedback and user testing.</p>

                    <p>As part of our iterative development process, the product backlog will change while we work on the current sprint. Your priorities will change, and requirements will become clearer as we discuss them in more detail. At the end of each sprint we review the previous sprint, and work with you to agree the next based off the priorities in the product backlog. Depending on the project, we will release the work from that sprint into production</p>
