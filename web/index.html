        <h2 class="alternative">Web Development</h2>
        <p>Web development is our speciality. We love building online solutions to complex business problems. Be it an online management system for your business and clients, a Software-as-a-Service style web application, or anything in between - we can help.</p>
        <p>We have experience in building a range of different online systems: feedback management systems, e-commerce platforms, collaboration systems, social networking tools, Facebook and Twitter integrations, online accounting tools, and online project management systems - so we can help your business with its online requirements.</p>
        <p>With our web development services, you don't simply give us a list of requirements, and wait for the end result - it's an iterative and collaborative exercise. We will work with you to develop the requirements, and build a product backlog. Once we start developing, code changes are automatically hooked up to our quality and deployment systems - this let's us run automated tests on the code, and the end product, to ensure it meets the requirements and to help spot issues when the requirements do change. Code changes are regularly released to our staging servers, so you can see the product take shape, and provide feedback. We work in short iterative sprints, which allow us to bend and flex should the needs of your business change during the development process. We work tirelessly to get a usable version of your system ready, and in use, so that you can prioritse the requirements based off the needs of your users.</p>
