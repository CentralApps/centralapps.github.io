        <h2 class="alternative">Mobile Development</h2>
        <p>We can build the systems, web services and APIs you need in order to build a useful and successful mobile application. While native Mobile Application Development isn't something we do ourselves, we work with a number of talented mobile specialists in the North East.</p>

        <p>We can work with you to capture the needs of your business, and recommend the best solution for you. Sometimes a responsive web-based application is all you need, in other cases, a native iOS (iPhone or iPad) or Android app is more appropriate. Often there are hybrid aproaches which might be suitable too, with either a native application providing a more seamless experience, or providing tighter integration with the mobile device when required.</p>

        <p>Not only can we develop the <strong>server side</strong> web services and APIs required for your mobile application to function, and integrate with your online systems, we can also manage the whole project - using agile development methodologies, industry best practices, web based project management tools to keep you in the loop, and both testing servers and access to regular test builds of your mobile application.</p>
