        <p>We have a wealth of experience when it comes to all aspects of software development - we can help you with the tools, processes and techniques - even if you don't need us to develop software for you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Perhaps you are a marketing or design agency that wants to start moving into digital and need the processes and practices introduced, so a relatively junior team can rapidly deliver for your clients?
            </li>
            <li>
                Thinking of investing in a software venture, or making an aquisition? We can perform technical due diligence so you know exactly what position the technology is in, as well as making recommendations for improvements.
            </li>
        </ul>

                        <h3>Deployment</h3>
                        <p>Processes to automatically deploy your projects: summarise changes, email stakeholders, backup and migrate your platform at the press of a button.</p>

                        <h3>Automated testing</h3>
                        <p>Automatically test your code - run unit tests to ensure that code performs as expected, and acceptance tests to check that the end to end process for your users is as expected - and take automated screenshots when it fails.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Code quality</h3>
                        <p>Measure and track code quality over time: are the tests passing? is the code too complex? how is the code test coverage? Does the code conform to accepted coding standards?<p>

                        <h3>Defect and exception tracking</h3>
                        <p>Get alerted to issues and exceptions in your code when they occur, so your team can work to quickly resolve the issues.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Technical Due-diligence</h3>
                        <p>We can review a software product, company or team and provide due diligence for investors to ensure the right systems and processes are in place for smooth development, and that the products code and infrastructure is of sufficient quality to facilitate rapid, agile development of new features.</p>

                        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
                        <p>We can recommend and implement an appropriate infrastructure for your project: servers, databases, load balancers, deployment, and scaling: these are all things we can put in place for your web projects.</p>

                        <h3>Scalability</h3>
                        <p>Will your product scale? What will happen as your userbase grows? And just as importantly, can your code cope with rapid development changes, as the needs of your business change?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-3">

                        <h3>Project management</h3>
                        <p>We can work with your technical teams to manage your software project. We use agile development methodologies, and a suite of tools and services to provide an open, clear and iterative development process - giving you constant access to test systems.</p>
